		<br>Common Evaluation Approaches:
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Pre and Post-<br>Single Group</td>
	<td>
	Comparison Over Time Collecting Information from the <strong>Same Group</strong>:  Collect evaluation information from the same people, places, or events before and after the intervention, or at multiple time points following the intervention. 
	<br><br>
	Examples:  1) A sample of program participants are surveyed before an educational intervention begins and those <strong>same</strong> participants are surveyed again after the intervention has been delivered; 2) PTA meeting minutes, school board documents, and key stakeholders interview responses are reviewed before and after school policy interventions are implemented; 3) Exterior tobacco ads are counted before and after a retailer educational intervention and community POP media campaign are implemented.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Pre and Post-<br>Cross Sectional</td>
	<td>
	Comparison Over Time Collecting Information from Two Different Groups:  Collect evaluation information from <strong>two different groups</strong> of people, places, or events before and after the intervention. 
	<br><br>
	Example:  A random sample of community members are surveyed about their tobacco related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors before a media campaign and a second sample of community members are given the same survey after the media campaign. Results from the two surveys are compared to determine positive changes in overall community knowledge, attitudes and behaviors.  
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Control Group</td>
	<td>
	There are three basic variations of a control group evaluation approach:<br>
	1.  <strong>Comparison Between an Intervention Group and a Non-Intervention Group:</strong>  Collect evaluation information from a group that received the intervention and from a similar group that did not receive the intervention and then compare findings for differences.
	<br><br>
	Example:  Compare smoke free home attitudes and behaviors among staff and parents of surveys administered at two similar day care facilities within a community after an intervention was delivered, one agency that was exposed to the intervention and one that was not.
	<br><br>
	2. <strong>Comparison Over Time Between an Intervention Group and a Non-Intervention Group:</strong>  A stronger evaluation design; collect evaluation information before and after an intervention from a group that received the intervention and also from a similar group that did not receive the intervention and then compare before and after results between both groups for differences.
	<br><br>
	Example: A baseline observational study is first conducted to assess the extent of exterior tobacco ads of two local convenience stores.  One retailer then receives an intervention and one does not.  A follow-up observation is then conducted of both stores to compare possible differences in POP advertising with the one retailer.
	<br><br>
	3. <strong>Comparison Over Time Between a Randomly Selected Group assigned to Receive an Intervention and a Group Randomly Assigned to NOT Receive the Intervention:</strong> A strong evaluation design; Individuals from the target population are randomly assigned to either a group that will receive an intervention or a group that will not, evaluation information is collected from both groups after (or before and after) the intervention has been delivered and results are compared for differences.
	<br><br>
	Example: Three pharmacists located within county X are randomly assigned to receive a Quitline promotion intervention and three other pharmacists are assigned to a control group and will not receive the intervention.   Pharmacist interviews to assess level of promotion of the Quitline and an observation study to assess the existence of Quitline promotional materials are conducted at all 6 pharmacies before and after the promotional campaign.  Pre-intervention results are compared to post intervention results for each of the 6 pharmacists to determine differences in Quitline promotion.  The post intervention results for the 3 pharmacists who received the intervention are then compared against the 3 who did not to also determine if change occurred .

	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Discrete Action/Outcome Assessment</td>
	<td>
	Some evaluations assess a clear and discrete outcome that is expected to result from your program. This type of evaluation approach should be used when the expected outcome represents a significant local achievement in behavior, policy, or organizational practice that will require a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources.  This approach requires minimal collection of information that is usually not quantitative or numerical but more qualitative and descriptive of the particular local experience surrounding the achievement of the outcome.  
	<br><br>
	Examples: 1) An intervention with a school PTA has the expected outcome of having the PTA take an action against smoking in movies by sending supporting letters to the MPAA and also presenting the issue to the school board on your programs’ behalf.  These are impacts of your program and would be measured by whether or not the letter was sent by the PTA and whether the PTA followed through on the commitment to play an active supporting role such as presenting to the board.  2) Passing a resolution by a local legislature or other decision making body would be another example of this type discrete outcome evaluation.

This type of collaborator usually participates in a limited way, on a single project or focus. This partner brings a specific skill, significant component or community connection that is vital to moving a project forward to success. A non-traditional partner will fade away after success has been reached, but if the topic/focus is revisited, they may come back to assist or provide Technical Assistance to the TCP community partner.  In contrast, a traditional partner is usually in a field that has traditionally worked on public health (and perhaps specifically tobacco control) issues, such as ACS or ALA.
	<br><br>An example of a non-traditional partner is a county legislator who actively participates in a community partnership while they are working toward enforcement of the Clean Indoor Air Law. Once the enforcement legislation is passed, the county legislator will no long attend meetings or participate in other community partnership projects.
	<br><br>An example of a Reality Check non-traditional partner is a local movie theater manager who agrees to run smoke free movie ads before every G and PG-13 movie shown on weekends during the school year's summer break.
